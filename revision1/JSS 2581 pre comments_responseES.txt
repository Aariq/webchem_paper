From the editorial team:

o Rather than using a goo.gl link, the official stable CRAN URL should be used: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=webchem
=> Changed


Manuscript style comments:

o Title in title style (“retrieve” should be capitalized).
=> Changed

o \section, \subsection, etc. should be in sentence style (see http://www.jstatsoft.org/about/submissions), e.g., change “4. Use Cases” to “4. Use cases”
=> Changed

o The code presented in the manuscript should not contain comments within the verbatim code. Instead the comments should be made in the normal LaTeX text.
=> Removed all comments from the code blocks and clarified in the text.

o For the code layout in R publications, the input should use the text width (up to 76 or 77 characters) and be indented by two spaces, e.g.,

begin{Sinput}
R> example_model <- lm(response ~ variable1 + variable2 + variable3, 
+    weights = w, data = mydata)
\end{Sinput}
=> Set width to 76 characters, and removed excessive intendation

o For R-related manuscripts: The first argument of data() and library() should always be quoted, e.g., library("foo"). [' library(webchem)', ' data(jagst)', ' data(lc50)']
=> changed accordingly

o If using "e.g." and "i.e." add a comma after the period to keep LaTeX from interpreting them as the end of a sentence, i.e.: "e.g., " and "i.e., ".
=>  we added a backslash ("i.e.\ " or "e.g.\ "), which also prevents this.


o There should not be further footnote-style annotations in tables; these should all be placed in the caption.
=> we removed the footnotestyle annotation from table 1.

o As a reminder, please make sure that:
	- \proglang, \pkg and \code have been used for highlighting throughout the paper (including titles and references), except where explicitly escaped.
=> We checked thoroughly.


References:

o Springer-Verlag (not: Springer)
=> Change accordingly

o Please make sure that all software packages are \cite{}'d properly.
=> We checked thoroughly and updated the citations. 

o See FAQ for specific reference instructions.


Code:

o Please make sure that the files needed to replicate all code/examples within the manuscript are included in a standalone replication script.
=> These are given in the accompanying file "article.R"
